<section id="About">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey! My name is Jesus Baltazar, and I am an aspiring Front-End/Back-End Developer, Software Engineer, and Data Analyst (Recently got into Data). </p>
    <p>I am currently pursuing an Undergraduate Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (BA) at CUNY Hunter College. </p>
    <p class="par">My first introduction to the world of coding was in the 6th grade of middle school. I had taken my first "serious" Computer Science class, and my first language that I was ever introduced to was HTML! Since then, I knew I wanted to do something with programming, I just did not know what. I didn't receive much exposure to coding after the 6th grade, until my second year of High school. I learned Python, and its relation to game development. This pushed me into wanting to get into that realm of programming. I tried to download game engines and learn them, but rather opted in for the more basic approach, learning more languages.</p>
    <p class="par">When I reached college, I knew I had been exposed to the world of code and was comfortable enough to where I wanted to pursue it on my own time as well as in school. At the time of writing this, I took one class on Python, and one class on C++, and on my own time, started to learn Javascript, and also practicing HTML and CSS. I intend to keep going on this path and introduce new projects and ideas to this site. I initially entered college with the thought that I would be a Game Developer/Game Designer. The more things I was exposed to, and the more research I did, the more I decided to branch out. I still am interested in making games at some point, but in order to start somewhere, I want to tackle the challenges of Web Development, and getting used to the world of Front and Back End development.</p>
    <p class="par">What I plan to do in the future is work somewhere in the area of Front-End development. Working with HTML/CSS, some JavaScript and other frameworks, but also working with the idea of designing websites also interests me. As I continue to learn more about CSS and perfect my "vision" with designing, this website will be periodically updated with new looks and functionalities.
    <p class="par"> For now, though, I am in college, on the hunt for internships, and working on my own projects!</p>
