<section id="About">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey! My name is Jesus Baltazar, and I am an aspiring Front-End/Back-End Developer, Software Engineer, and Data Analyst (Recently got into Data). </p>
    <p>I am currently pursuing an Undergraduate Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (BA) at CUNY Hunter College. I am looking to make an <b>impact</b> in the world using technology. Whether it be raising awareness or contributing to projects for the greater good! </p>
    <p class="par">My first introduction to the world of coding was in the 6th grade of middle school. I had taken my first "serious" Computer Science class, and my first language that I was ever introduced to was <b>HTML</b>! Since then, I knew I wanted to do something with programming, I just did not know what. I didn't receive much exposure to coding after the 6th grade, until my second year of High school. I learned <b>Python</b>, and its relation to game development. This pushed me into wanting to get into that realm of programming. I tried to download game engines and learn them, but rather opted in for the more basic approach, learning more languages.</p>
    <p class="par">When I reached college, I was exposed to the world of code and was comfortable enough to where I wanted to pursue it on my own time as well as in school. At the time of writing this, I have taken one class on Python, and one class on <b>C++</b>, and on my own time, started to learn <b>Javascript</b>, and also practicing HTML and CSS. I intend to keep going on this path and introduce new projects and ideas to this site. I initially entered college with the thought that I would be a Game Developer/Game Designer. The more things I was exposed to, and the more research I did, the more I decided to branch out.</p>
    <p class="par">What I plan to do in the future is work somewhere in the area of <b>Web development</b>, but am VERY interested in exploring the areas of <b>Software Engineering</b>, and <b>Data Analysis</b>. Working with HTML/CSS, some JavaScript and other frameworks, but also working with the idea of designing websites also interests me. As I continue to learn more about CSS and perfect my "vision" with designing, this website will be periodically updated with new looks and functionalities.
