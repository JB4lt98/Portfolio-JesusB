<h1 class="eda">Data Analyis EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)</h1>
<p class="par">I've yet to start it (will soon), but the idea is that I take the data of complaints made to the NYPD (data from OpenData NYC), and I plan to filter it by borough, neighborhoods in the borough, demographics in each, income, and try to see if there is any correlation.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="par"> The questions I intend to answer are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What is a common trait between all these boroughs? Neighborhoods?</li>
    <li>What type of complaints are made in each?</li>
    <li>Are the complaints in correlation to the area?</li>
    <li>Does Crime Rate have anything to do with this? Crime Rate/Criminal Activity</li>
</ul>

<p class="par"> Stay tuned for this one!</p>
